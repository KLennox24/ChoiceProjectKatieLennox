# Fight or Flight Game

This game uses conditionals and user input to take the user through a series of customized scenarios until the end of the game.

## Description

This project uses if/else commands and variables to lead the user through five scenarios. Based on the user's response, the variable for the scenario will either be set as 'True', 'False', or 'Pass' which will determine the next print command. The majority of code is split into the print commands for the scenarios, and the variables the will decide the next print commands. If the user does not type what the code expects it to, the code will not run correctly. To add new scenarios, scenario five would have to be changed, or new scenarios would need to be added afterwards. To use this code, fork the repl.it project, and add your own changes. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To run the code, the code IDE repl.it needs to be used, and code language Python 3 is what the code uses.

### Installing

The code currently works with the scenarios used, but to add more, fork the code in repl.it, or run the code in this project to play the game.

### Executing program

How to Run the Program:
* Click the 'Run' button to start the code
* Follow the code instructions on information about what to do 
* Respond to each scenario with the correct, capitalized choice for the code to run correctly 
* If these instructions are not followed, the code will not run, and the code will need to be restarted
* To restart the code, stop the code by hitting the 'Stop' button, and hit the 'Run' button to start the code again

## Help

A common issue when creating new scenarios would be not using the correct variables, this can lead to confusion. Naming the variables appropriately makes the code easier to understand, and running the code after each major addition can be useful
